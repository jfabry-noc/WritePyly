# WritePyly

Project to create a Python CLI and TUI client for Write.as/WriteFreely instances.

## Description

The goal of the project is to provide a simple CLI client for pushing content to a WriteFreely instance, deleting posts from that instance, etc. In the future, I'd like to add functionality to create a TUI when no arguments are passed. It will also (hopefully) be distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) once it gets to a point where I feel like that's warranted.

## Installation

Since this is still an early work in progress, all of this is subject to change as it matures. Currently you'll need to clone the repo directly:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/loopednetwork/writepyly.git
````

Once in the project directory from the CLI, create a virtual environment, activate it, and the install the dependencies:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

All of this is also subject to change since the long-term goal is to make this a package that can be distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). If you want to play with it prior to it being mature enough for that, though, the following should work. The entrypoint can be accessed by calling `__main__.py` directly:

```shell
./src/__main__.py {commands}
```

Anything in the `help` option should have `writepyly` replaced with `__main__.py` until it's actually bundled as a package for PyPI.

To get out of the virtual environment, run:

```shell
deactivate
```

## Usage

The main options offered currently are:

- `help`
- `get`
- `login`
- `logout`
- `post`
- `get`
- `delete`

### `help`

This displays the help information running it by itself...

```shell
writepyly help
```

... will show the generic help message. It can be combined with any of the commands above to display additional, more specific information. For example, to show more details on the `post` command, run:

```shell
writepyly help post
```

### `get`

This retrieves all of the posts from a collection and displays the following:

- title
- creation date
- ID

If the post has an actual title, that will be displayed. Otherwise, the first 50 character of the post will be shown instead. The main use case is to get an ID for post management. Assuming the collection is [api-tester](https://apitester.looped.network/), the command would be:

```shell
writepyly get api-tester
```

By default, this will return **all** posts with the associated collection. _Note_ that only collections can be queried in this way, so a collection is mandatory. If you want to receive pages of posts, pass an integer as an additional parameter. For example, to receive pages of 10 posts, execute:

```shell
writepyly get api-tester 10
```

After each page, the user will be prompted to either continue to the next page or to press `q` (case insensitive) to stop.

### `login`

This is used to either log in for the first time or to overwrite the current login information. Logging in reqires providing:

- username
- password
- instance

__Note__: The main goal currently isn't anonymous posting, so you may see weird, untested behavior if you try doing anything without authentication.

The "username" and "password" are what you would normally use to log in to your WriteFreely instance. The instance itself is the domain name (sans any protocol, like `https`) you use. If you're a [Write.as](https://write.as/) user, for example, then the instance is just `write.as`. It's important to note that the instance is the domain where you _actually_ authenticate. For example, if you're a Write.as user with a custom domain configured, you would still use `write.as` as the instance since that's where authentication happens.

Authentication commands should look like:

```shell
writepyly {username} {password} {instance}
```

For example, to log in to `write.as` as the user `looped`, run:

```shell
writepyly looped Abc123 write.as
```

The credentials are **not** stored locally, though the access token received in response is. It will be placed into the following file:

`~/.config/writepyly/config.json`

If you want to remove authorization, you should **not** delete the above file. Instead, run the `logout` command.

### `logout`

This command will first attempt to invalidate its locally cached access token against the instance in use. Regardless of the success or failure, the locally cached token and instance are then removed, as the following file is deleted:

`~/.config/writepyly/config.json`

It's highly recommended to use this command rather than deleting the file manually, as then the access token is still valid on the server side.

### `post`

This command allows for new posts to be submitted. There are two primary options:

- Provide the path to a Markdown file with the content to post.
- Read content from STDIN through the pipeline.

Paths to Markdown files can be either fully qualified or relative. For example, to use a Markdown file located in a directory up in a folder called `sample_data` which is named `test_post.md`, enter:

```shell
writepyly post ../sample_data/test_post.md
```

This will publish anonymously and is currently untested functionality. To publish to a collection you own, simply append the collection name as an additional parameter, such as this example where we're posting to the collection called `api-tester`:

```shell
writepyly post ../sample_data/test_post.md api-tester
```

If reading from STDIN, just replace the file path with `--`. The following command would achieve the same as the command above:

```shell
cat ../sample_data/test_post.md | writepyly post -- api-tester
```

### `delete`

This command will delete a given post. It requires a post ID as a parameter:

```shell
writepyly delete {post_id}
```

To easily retrieve a post ID, use the `get` command.

## Roadmap

Simply rounding out and making the above functionality more robust is the first step on the roadmap. Once that's complete, it'll be up for consideration to make a package for distribution.

After the CLI functionality has been fully fleshed out, I would like to look at making an entrypoint into a TUI using something like [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) so the UI looks better. Along with post management, I'd like to at least attempt creating a post editor that could be used for:

1. Creating new posts
2. Editing existing posts

## Project status

This project is currently super early on. I just work on it when I have time. ðŸ’œ
